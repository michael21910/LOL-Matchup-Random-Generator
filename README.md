## Small story :speech_balloon:
Well, my friends and I decide to play a speical mode in League of Legends when there are more than 5 people some day.  
The inspiration is from: [this link](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Rm411Z7cN/?spm_id_from=333.1007.tianma.1-1-1.click&vd_source=6ea4fc21235d890de542dc9c53e1e4c6)  
The guys in the video plays a special mode made by themselves, that is to randomize the champions, runes, summoner spells, and first items for every people.  
Sadly, to draw lots for all of the factors and to check the corresponding factors is a waste of time, so I decide to solve this problem.  
I guess we are going to play this special mode tomorrow night :D
